    <h3 class="head">School of Engineering</h3>
    <p class="content" align="justify">
      The traditional engineering curriculum offered by multitude of engineering colleges across the country generally falls short of stressing design, quality, system integration, creative thinking and problem solving skills, as well as other
      analytical and interpersonal skills. The result is that most of the graduating engineers are deemed unemployable.
      <br>
      <br>

      Acquiring such characteristics is unlikely with our traditional, passive, lecture-based learning and exam intensive-degree oriented structure.
      <br>
      <br>
      A new engineering education paradigm is needed, characterized by active, project based learning; horizontal and vertical integration of subject matter; introduction of mathematical and scientific concepts in the context of application; close
      interaction with industry; broad use of information technology; and a faculty devoted to developing emerging professionals as mentors, rather than as all-knowing dispensers of information.
      <br>
      <br>
      The School of Engineering of Ajeenkya DY Patil University is based on this vision to better prepare engineering graduates to meet the needs of engineering employers and meet the expectations of our society from engineers to catapult India to
      next generation of excellence. The curriculum is designed to give students the breadth of information and training needed to be immediately productive in their first job. We believe this is engineering education for the 21st Century.

    <h3 class="subhead">Innoventive Engineering</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="content" align="justify">
      Innoventive engineering is a radical new approach to engineering education that is grounded in engineering design powered by design thinking, focuses on identifying and solving real – world problems for real people and aspires to produce
      entrepreneurs and innovators.
      <br>
      <br>
      Innoventive Engineering engages engineering students with a real problem, which has no given solution in an industrial / social context, develop social and collaborative skills, introduce new product development methods in a project
      environment.
      <br>
      <br>
      This radical approach will enable engineering students to develop products and services around those products that are innovative, useful, safe, aesthetically appropriate, ecologically sound and socially beneficial while serving the needs of
      society, consumers, manufacturers and the environment.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subhead"> Design</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="content" align="justify">
      National Academy of Engineering, USA recognizes that engineering is, since its origin, a “profoundly creative process”. It suggests that engineering is about design under constraint and says that an activity of an engineer is directed to the
      creation of “a successful design”.
      <br>
      <br>
      At the core of Innoventive Engineering is a “Design Spine” within the engineering curriculum. The Design Spine courses would be the major vehicle for developing a set of competencies to meet educational goals in areas such as creative thinking,
      problem solving, teamwork, and Design.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Design Spine sequence of courses will arm students with sufficient knowledge of fundamental design principles and will encourage multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary design processes, challenging students to develop their intellectual
      competence and project management skills. Students will develop analytical skills, and creative potential.
      <br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the proposed program is to enable undergraduate engineering students to develop design knowledge and skills that will prepare them to be innovative and creators of new value.
      <br>
      <br>
      Design Thinking transcends disciplinary boundaries and adopts a fluid process to address a wide range of problems and issues. Harvard Business Review, 2008 defines Design Thinking, as a methodology that imbues the full spectrum of innovation
      activities with a human-centered design ethos… Innovation is powered by a thorough understanding, through direct observation, of what people want and need in their lives and what they like or dislike about the way particular products are made,
      packaged, marketed, sold and supported.”
      <br>
      <br>
      Design thinking encompasses people (by observing them and gaining insights through their behavior patterns), ideating (brainstorming, looking at a problem from multiple perspective), prototyping (visually representing the thinking) and story
      narration (implementation by selling compelling narratives not “concepts”).
      <br>
      <br>
      Design Thinking has the potential to provide learning opportunities for engineering students to explore human desirability, technical feasibility and business viability. It means systems thinking, breaking out of the normal confines, solving
      the fundamental issues, not the symptoms. Design thinking is a powerful approach to innovation and problem solving in the diverse contexts of engineering.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subhead">People Focused Engineering</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="content" align="justify">
      Engineers need to broaden their outlooks to be relevant and successful. The education and general orientation of engineers have been directed inward toward the profession, rather than outward toward the rest of society and the world. We believe
      that engineering education should create a broader outlook and understanding in graduates and thereby engender newer capabilities to effectively face the challenges of the future world.
      <br>
      <br>
      The complexity surrounding engineering projects is increasing everyday. Natural resources are dwindling and the world population is increasing. The global infrastructure and economy are becoming more intertwined. In such a scenario, the
      creativity and innovation necessary to address the big issues facing civilization— maintaining the infrastructure; providing food, water, shelter, and power to the population; and growing sustainable and safely—will only increase in importance.
      <br>
      <br>
      Engineering curricula, with their focus on the disciplinary contributions to design, encourage a mindset in which students seek technical solutions often rooted in a specific engineering discipline with little regard for the context in which
      their product, system, or service may be deployed, the societal or business need it may fulfill or even its relations to all the other engineering, business or ‘environmental’ domains that can contribute to success.
      <br>
      <br>
      Over 90% of new products introduced into the marketplace fail. A good portion of these failures are due to lack of understanding of end consumers and their needs. To develop truly successful new products, it’s not enough just to ask people what
      they need or want.
      <br>
      <br>
      Engineers need tools and techniques to get beyond what people can explicitly state and determine their implicit needs. The requirements extend beyond the traditional discipline specific technical knowledge to include product and system building
      knowledge and skills, personal and professional skills and interpersonal skills.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subhead">Entrepreneurship</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="content" align="justify">
      The school of engineering offers a super-charged environment where students, faculty and industry works together to solve the most complex of the problems leading to exciting new solutions. Through the incubator at the school of engineering,
      novel ideas get a life to progress from concept to market. Through the innovation factory students work with industry and students from other disciplines on projects offered by the industry. This approach brings the real-world in the classroom
      and creates a pathway for creating next generation entrepreneurs and innovators.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subhead">Curriculum</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="=content" align="justify">
      Our curriculum is designed to make our students, Innoventive Engineers. While embarking on the task to define and design the course structure for this unique program, we decided to use internationally accepted benchmarks. For the course
      curriculum we selected benchmark provided by Accreditation Board of Engineering & Technology (ABET), USA.
      <br>
      <br>
      Students while being educated in an increasingly broad range of technologies, simultaneously require developing personal, interpersonal, and system-building skills. We decided to use Conceive – Design – Implement – Operate (CDIO) to define
      expected outcomes in terms of learning objectives of the personal, interpersonal, and system building skills necessary for modern engineering practice.
      <br>
      <br><br>
      <br>
      The engineering curriculum is delivered on the basis of recommendations of CDIO approach. CDIO – Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate is an exciting innovation that will provide the educational context for the next generation of engineering
      leaders. The CDIO approach meets the needs of students, faculty and industry by collecting and formalizing the knowledge, skills and attributes that student’s desire and that industry leaders expect graduating engineers to have.
      <br>
      <br>
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Chalmers University of Technology, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and Linköping University (LiU) formed a coalition to develop a new model for engineering education. The project goes under the
      acronym CDIO that refers to the overall goal of the project to make the Conception-Design-Implementation-Operation (CDIO) the context of engineering education, while at the same time developing students with active and deep working knowledge of
      basic engineering science.
      <br>
      <br>
      The highlight of CDIO approach is a statement of what engineers do, and thus, the functions that a graduating student must be able to perform upon graduation: “Graduating engineers should be able to conceive-design-implement-operate complex
      value-added engineering systems in a modern team-based environment”.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subhead"> Teaching Methodology</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="content" align="justify">
      An Innoventive curriculum needs similarly powerful delivery mechanism. We are proud of our distinctive delivery mechanism that engages students and motivates them to aspire for more.
      <br>
      <br>
      Students get a real world experience while solving interesting problems in the classroom which not only brings dynamism in the classroom, but also instills in them an entrepreneurial spirit right from the early years. Teachers employ
      problem-based learning where they connect the topic being taught to a real world situation through appropriate cases, simulations and interesting discussions.
      <br>
      <br>
      It is quite often that the teacher would ask the students to go through the study material in advance through an online resource or a reading list and dedicate the class time for discussions and problem solving. This approach helps to make
      better use of the available time and enables the students to be life-long learners.
      <br>
      <br>
      While there will be many small projects within the course, that the students will work on, the students start being a part of a major multidisciplinary team project right from the first year. This three year project moves along with subject
      knowledge and skills acquired by the students in successive years and leads to a major achievement by the end of third year.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through problem-based learning, in-class projects and the three year project the students extend their sphere of thinking, refine their solutions and seek to find out the best possible solution for a given problem. This helps to instill
      proclivity for invention and innovation amongst the students.
      <br>
      <br>
      Following in the humanistic tradition of engineering, we offer course credits from the humanities and liberal arts areas. Some of these credits are essential for course completition, thus putting in place a method to prepare well rounded
      engineers.
      <br>
      <br>
      A very special emphasis is placed on first year engineering as it is the year which sets in motion the pathway for becoming a great engineer and wonderful human being. The first year courses are integrated in a powerful sequence that combines
      engineering analysis, design, programming and computer graphics. Students learn engineering mathematics covering linear algebra and calculus. They learn physics and applied mechanics. They are introduced to MATLAB programming and are introduced
      to engineering design. The design component introduces them to design thinking early on and teaches them to communicate ideas powerfully. This portion of the first year course encourages the students to understand that whatever they do, they
      are eventually designing for people and they must take in to account what people value while imagining something new. The portion helps students to take in to account the social context while solving problems. Throughout the emphasis is on
      finding the right problem to solve, instead of simply learning how to solve a problem and thereafter and how to take a solution from mind in to the world.</p>
